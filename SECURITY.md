# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep open source software safe for everyone.

If you believe you've identified a security vulnerability in this project, you
can either:

- Open a [private security issue on GitHub](https://github.com/epistrephein/rubies/security/advisories/new)
- Reach out to the maintainer at <tommasobarbato@gmail.com>

Please avoid reporting such issues on public GitHub issues or in other public
spaces to give maintainers time to publish a fix without exposing users to
increased risk.
